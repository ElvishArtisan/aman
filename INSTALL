This is the installation file for the Aman package.

MANDATORY PREREQUISITES
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building Aman:

MySQL Database Server, v5.0 or better.  (http://www.mysql.org)
Because of the way the Aman generates and installs database snapshots,
it is crucial that the version of MySQL employed on each server be
compatible at the binary level.  Ideally, an identical version of MySQL
should be employed on each.

Open SSH Secure Shell Connectivity Tool (http://www.openssh.org/).

Qt5 Toolkit, v5.9.7 or better (http://www.trolltech.com/).

Perl Interpreter, along with the DBI and Term::ReadKey modules.
(http://www.cpan.org/).

RSync File Transfer Utility (rsync.samba.org).

X11 Window System
Virtually all Linux distros should include this.


BUILD ENVIRONMENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some distros may require that the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS
environmental variables be set prior to running 'configure' in order for
Qt4 to be detected properly.  Some known cases are:

  CentOS/RedHat 5 (i386): export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/lib/qt4/include
                	  export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib/qt4/lib
                	  export PATH=/usr/lib/qt4/bin:$PATH

CentOS/RedHat 5 (x86_64): export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/lib64/qt4/include
                 	  export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib64/qt4/lib64
                	  export PATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/bin:$PATH

Ubuntu:                   export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/qt4


INSTALLATION
Once the prerequisites are set up, building and installation of the code is
done by cd'ing to the top of the source tree and typing './configure
[options]', 'make', followed (as root) by 'make install'.  Those who
obtained the source via CVS will need to do './autogen.sh' first.  There
are a number of options for the 'configure' script; do './configure --help'
for a detailed list.


CONFIGURATION
Once the software is installed, you will need to configure the various
components on each server to work properly together.  The steps below
will need to be performed on each server.

1) Generate ssh(1) keys.
From a root shell, do:

     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /var/aman/keys/id_ed25519

Leave the passphrase blank.  After the command completes, copy the file
'/var/aman/keys/id_ed25519.pub' to the '/root/.ssh/authorized_keys' file
on the other server.

2) Populate the host key.
From a root shell, test that you can access the remote system by doing:

     ssh -i /var/aman/keys/id_ed25519 <rmt-server-ip>

You may be prompted to confirm the remote system's identity with a message like:

    The authenticity of host '<rmt-server-ip> (<rmt-server-ip>)' can't be
    established.  RSA key fingerprint is <rsa-key-fingerprint>.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

Enter 'yes' and confirm that you are logged into the remote system, then
enter 'exit'.

3) Edit /etc/aman.conf.
Start with the commented sample configuration file 'aman.conf-sample'
provided with this package.  The exact same configuration file should be
used on both servers.

4) Configure MySQL.
On a RHEL-6 system, this is a matter of copying the appropriate sample
configuration file ('my.cnf-SystemA-rhel6-sample' or
'my.cnf-SystemB-rhel6-sample') to '/etc/my.cnf'. For an RHEL-7 system,
copy the 'aman.cnf-SystemA-rhel7-sample' or 'aman.cnf-SystemB-rhel7-sample'
file to '/etc/my.cnf.d/aman.cnf'. After copying the config files restart
the MySQL service.

Create a 'repl' user in MySQL with rights to connect from both the
private and public IP addresses of each server and with the following
privileges on the 'Rivendell' database:

     Select
     Insert
     Update
     Create
     Delete
     Reload
     Super
     Replication Slave
     Replication Client

Once the '/etc/aman.conf' file has been created, the
'aman_add_replication_users.pl' script can be used to add these users
with the appropriate privileges semi-automatically.

5) RSync Configuration.
Create an RSync mountpoint named 'rivendell' that provides read-only
access to the '/var/snd' directory from the other server.  A sample
snippet for the '/etc/rsyncd.conf' file can be found in 'rsyncd.conf-sample'.
For systems such as RHEL-6 which start rsyncd(8) by means of xinetd(8), a
sample rsync service configuration for xinetd(8) is also provided in
'rsync.xinetd-sample'.  Ensure that the rsyncd service is started.

6) Audio Replication Check File.
Create the check file by doing the following commands from a root shell:

       touch /var/snd/repl.chk
       chown rivendell:rivendell /var/snd/repl.chk
       chmod 660 /var/snd/repl.chk

7) Start the amand(8) Daemon.
Start the amand(8) daemon by doing:

      service amand start

from a root shell.  You should now be able to run the aman(8) applet
from the 'System Tools' menu to configure and monitor replication.
